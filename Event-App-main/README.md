The alumni address book is finely classified into colleges, majors, and grades, so that it is no longer difficult for you to find people on campus.

Persona 1: Harry is a freshman at ASU and he loves soccer. But his roommates and classmates were not interested in the sport. So he needed a way to find a lot of people who also love soccer so they could play soccer together on weekends.

Persona 2: Jack is a software developer for a company near asu. His hobby is basketball. He always comes to asu to play basketball in his spare time. But he didn't always meet someone playing basketball, which forced him to play basketball alone. So he needed a way to get in touch with ASU students.
